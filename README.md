‚ö†Ô∏è This is a work in progress. Don't attempt to use it for anything except developing Exekube (or inspiration).

# Exekube

*Exekube* is a declarative framework for administering Kubernetes clusters and deploying containerized software onto them.

You only need [Docker CE](/) and [Docker Compose](/) on your local machine to begin using Exekube. The framework is a thin layer on top of several open-source DevOps tools:

- Docker Compose (for our local development environment)
- Terraform and HCL (HashiCorp Language)
- Kubernetes
- Helm

Exekube allows you to manage both cloud infrastructure resources and Kubernetes resources using a git-based workflow with a continuous integration (CI) pipeline.

## Introduction

### Design Principles

- Everything on client side is dockerized
- Infrastructure (cloud provider) and Kubernetes API objects are expressed as declarative code, using Terraform HCL (HashiCorp Language) and Helm packages
- Git-based workflow with a CI pipeline [TBD]
- No vendor lock-in, choose any cloud provider you want [only GCP for now]
- Test-driven (TDD) or behavior-driven (BDD) model of development [TBD]

## Setup and usage

### Requirements starting from zero

Everything on your workstation runs in a container using Docker Compose.

The only requirements, depending on your local OS:

#### Linux

- [Docker](/)
- [Docker Compose](/)

#### macOS

- [Docker for Mac](/)

#### Windows

- [Docker for Windows](/)

### Local setup step-by-step

0. Create `xk` (stands for "exekube") alias for your shell session (or save to ~/.bashrc):
    ```bash
    alias xk="docker-compose run --rm exekube"
    ```
1. [Set up a Google Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) for GCP (Google Cloud Platform), create a project named "ethereal-argon-186217", and enable billing.
2. [Create a service account](/) in GCP Console GUI, give it project owner permissions.
3. [Download JSON credentials](/) ("key") to repo root directory and rename the file to `credentials.json`.
4. Use JSON credentials to activate service account:
    ```sh
    xk gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file credentials.json
    ```
5. Create Google Cloud Storage bucket (with versioning) for our Terraform remote state:
    ```sh
    xk gsutil mb -p ethereal-argon-186217 gs://ethereal-argon-terraform-state \
        && xk gsutil versioning set on gs://ethereal-argon-terraform-state
    ```
6. Declare the desired state for the cluster and cluster resources. [Guide to modifying the .tf and .tfvars files](/) [TODO]
7. Initialize terraform and create the cluster:
    ```sh
    xk init live/infra/gcp-ethereal-argon/
    xk apply live/infra/gcp-ethereal-argon/
    ```
8. Deploy core releases:
    ```sh
    xk init live/kube/core
    xk apply live/kube/core
    ```

### Usage / workflow

#### Legacy imperative workflow (CLI)

‚ö†Ô∏è These tools are relatively mature and work well, but are considered *legacy* here since this framework aims to be [declarative](/)

Command line tools `kubectl` and `helm` are known to those who are familiar with Kubernetes. `gcloud` (part of Google Cloud SDK) is used for managing the Google Cloud Platform.

- `xk gcloud`
- `xk kubectl`
- `xk helm`

```sh
xk helm install --name ingress-controller \
        -f live/kube/nginx-ingress.yaml \
        modules/helm-charts/kube-lego/

xk helm install --name letsencrypt-controller \
        helm/charts/kube-lego/

xk helm install --name my-nginx-page \
        -f live/kube/nginx-webpage-devel.yaml \
        modules/helm-charts/nginx-webpage/

xk helm install --name my-rails-app \
        -f live/kube/rails-app-devel.yaml \
        modules/helm-charts/rails-app/
```

#### Declarative workflow (HCL .tf files)

- `xk apply`

Declarative tools are exact equivalents of the legacy imperative (CLI) toolset, except everything is implemented as a [Terraform provider plugin](/) and expressed as declarative HCL (HashiCorp Language) code. Instead of writing CLI commands like `xk helm install --name <release-name> -f <values> <chart>` for each individual Helm release, we install all releases simultaneously by running `xk apply`.

## Feature tracker

Features are marked with ‚úîÔ∏è when they enter the *alpha stage*, meaning a minimum viable solution has been implemented

### Cloud provider and local environment setup

- [x] Create GCP account, enable billing in GCP Console (web GUI)
